This directory is the project directory for the
**node-red** implemention of direct control over the
Fishinator motors, sensors, and devices.

The implementation is based around using a Raspberry Pi
as the hardware with RaspbianOS installed.

The programming interface is on localhost:1880,
and the UI interface is on localhost:1880/ui

There is some currently un-documented electronic 
hardware between the Raspberry Pi and the Fishinator
actuators, real-time clock, LED bargraph, and OLED screen.
